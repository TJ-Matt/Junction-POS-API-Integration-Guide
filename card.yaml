  title: Junction@POS transaction API
  description: >-
    The Junction@POS APIs allow for card-based transactions to be peformed by a
    POS. There are two APIs, one being card, used to perform a payment, and the
    other being reverse, used to reverse the previously processed transaction. 
    A reversal always refers to the previously processed transaction, while a
    refund is a normal payment transaction type, and can be processed completely
    independently of a purchase transaction.
